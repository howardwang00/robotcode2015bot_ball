Notes:
The #include goes first
You MUST define the states before constructing the menuitem
Each state must have its own unique number
Calling next(s_END); will end the program
All code within the while loop must be inside a state

Basic sample program with menu code. You can copy and paste this and it will work:

//Included files
#include "newmenu.h"

//side programs
#define s_SIDE1 101
#define s_SIDE2 102
//etc.

//main programs
#define s_START 1
#define s_MID 2
#define s_FINAL 3
//etc.

#define s_END 0

struct menuitem menu[]=
{
	{s_START,"Start"},
	{s_MID,"Mid"},
	{s_FINAL,"Final"},
	{s_SIDE1,"Side 1"},
	{s_SIDE2,"Side 2"},
{s_END,"END"}};

int main()
{
	Get_Mode();
	//initializations, such as enable_servos();
	while(currstate!=s_END)
	{
		state(s_START)
		{
			//code
			next(s_MID);
		}
		state(s_MID)
		{
			//code
			next(s_FINAL);
		}
		state(s_FINAL)
		{
			//code
			next(s_END);
		}
		state(s_SIDE1)
		{
			//test code
			next(s_END);
		}
		state(s_SIDE2)
		{
			//test code
			next(s_END);
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
